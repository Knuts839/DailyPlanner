I have hit the core functionality for this planner. I have the timeblocks of standard working hours. You can click into and edit your time blocks. This application can both save and retrieve from local storage. Each save button is wired to save to local storage. Special note you must click save picture for it to save. There is no margin for error. The save feature is fully functional and it will save your entries and recover them.
